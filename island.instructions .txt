                   Forbidden Island Game Instructions
           By Raveena Jain (raveena97) and Sreeya Sai(ssai123) 

A 2-player game!
Player 1: CAPTAIN (arrow keys, pilot image)
Player 2: MR.WASD (wasd keys, angsty cat head image)

Types of Islands:
Mountain Island (initial island): highest point at center, floods from outside in
Random Island: heights scattered, helicopter placed at any of the highest points, floods by height 
Random Terrain Island: shape of island randomized, floods by height 

Goal of Game:
The goal of this game is for both players to collect all of the black gears and return to the helicopter. Once a piece is collected, it will disappear off of the screen. Both players MUST return to the helicopter for you to WIN!
If one or both pilots end(s) up on a flooded cell, unfortunately, you will drown and the game will end. 

Score:
Both playersâ€™ scores are tracked at the top of the screen. Every step (movement of pilot by one cell) a player takes adds one point to the score. The lower your score the better!
